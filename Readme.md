###Set intervals and timers on JavaScript.
###Using SASS to make CSS sassy

1. Window Timer
  * setInterval(function () { console.log(“cooke”); }, 1000);

2. SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) difference from CSS
  * variables  $variableName (widths, heights, color)
  * nest rules in just what it’s under (don’t go further than 2 or 3 levels of nesting)
  * Mixins (like a template, like using JS functions) set up to take an argument (x) you can identify the x
  * operators - do math on it to calculate width
  * lighten, darken
